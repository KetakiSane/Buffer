We have created an application for the student attendance system. The attenndance of the entire class can be taken within the time of a minute with utmost authentication. The user will have to enter his username and password which will help him generate a code which will be entered by the students along with their names and roll numbers and their attendance will be marked. The application also displays the defaulter list. 

Our initial plan was go forward with IOT to provide another aspect to authentication and security by checking if the entered student's device is present within the premises but due to the pandemic and shortfall of proper communication and precariousness of time we could not go forward with it.
